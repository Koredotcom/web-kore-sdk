# Kore Web SDK integration in Sharepoint
To integrate Kore Web SDK in SharePoint sites we need to use [SharePoint Framework(SPFx)](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/sharepoint/dev/spfx/sharepoint-framework-overview).

By developing the [client web part](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/sharepoint/dev/spfx/web-parts/overview-client-side-web-parts) using Single Page Application we will integrate Kore Web SDK.


## Below are the steps to integrate using Sharepoint framework(SPFx):
> [!NOTE]
> It is framework-agnostic, it can be used with any JavaScript framework â€“ React, Angular, Knockout and more. Here we are using React for creating web part. You can use any framework or library according to your convenience.

1. Create a web part using Sharepoint Framework using React by following the instructions given [here](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/sharepoint/dev/spfx/set-up-your-development-environment).

2. Now open the main component .tsx file.

   Note: You need to install Kore Web SDK in the relevant main file in the framework/library used. 


4. Generate the .sppkg file for the web part by following the [instructions](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/sharepoint/dev/spfx/web-parts/get-started/hosting-webpart-from-office-365-cdn#review-solution-settings).

5. #### Upload the .sppkg file(web part) to the SharePoint Apps:

   Go to your [SharePoint Admin Center](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=2185219).

Note: As we have restrictions with Custom Scripts execution in SharePoint we generally recommand SharePoint Framework solution rather than Modern Script Editor solution.
